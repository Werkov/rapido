== Overview

Rapido is a utility for quick testing of Linux kernel changes.

The scripts that make up Rapido are in themselves quite brainless. Most
of the heavy lifting is instead performed by:

https://dracut.wiki.kernel.org[Dracut]::
  Generates a VM image, with kernel-modules and minimal user-space.
http://qemu.org[QEMU]::
  Boots a given Dracut VM image and compiled Linux kernel on the local
  system.


== Setup

Rapido has a pretty minimal set of dependencies, which should be present
on all major Linux distributions.

- Dracut
- QEMU
- iproute2 with 'ip tuntap' support

Once all dependencies have been installed, Rapido can be configured via
rapido.conf (see rapido.conf.example). At a minimum, the Linux kernel
source parameters should be defined.

=== Network Configuration

Test VM images may be "cut" with or without network support. For
networking, the bridge, tap and MAC address parameters must be specified
in rapido.conf.
The 'rapido setup-network' command should be run as root to configure the
bridge network device.
By default, the bridge network is isolated, and isn't connected to any
physical adapters.


== Running

Depending on which kernel component or functionality you'd like to test,
choose a 'cut' script to generate a VM image, which pulls all relevant
kernel modules from the rapido.conf KERNEL_SRC directory. The VM
initramfs image will be written to 'initrds/myinitrd'.

The cut scripts can be executed by running the appropriate 'rapido cut'
command, like 'rapido cut fstests-btrfs'.

Once generated, the VM image and kernel can be booted by running
'rapido boot'.


== Adding Your Own Tests

Rapido can be easily extended to test any kernel functionality of
interest. To do so, make a copy of the 'cut/simple_example.sh' and
'autorun/simple_example.sh' scripts, and modify them to suit your needs.
The example scripts are fully annotated.
